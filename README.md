# Frollo iOS SDK Example

## Installation
Please make sure you follow the steps below when cloning this project or else it's not going to work
**This example project uses the [Frollo iOS SDK](https://bitbucket.org/frollo1/frollo-ios-sdk/src/master/) project as a submodule so developers are able to update the SDK whilst running this example project.**

1. Clone repo by executing the following command
```
git clone git@bitbucket.org:frollo1/frollo-ios-sdk-example.git --recurse-submodules
```
`--recurse-submodules` has to be added or else the frollo-ios-sdk submodule won't be pulled.

2. Open `Carfile` in root directory and replace `/xcode/frollo-ios-sdk-example/frollo-ios-sdk` with the **absolute path** of your frollo example project. (I wasn't able to make relative paths work in the Carfile, maybe it's not supported yet. So we have to update the file each time we pull new changes)  

## Bootstrapping environment

To get a new environment working for Frollo iOS use the following steps:


1. Install Homebrew - https://brew.sh/
2. Install Carthage using brew - `brew install carthage`
3. Bootstrap the dependencies (slow!) - `carthage bootstrap --platform iOS --no-use-binaries`
4. Install RVM - https://rvm.io/
5. Using Terminal in the root project directory active RVM - `rvm use .`
6. Install bundler - `gem install bundler`
7. Setup the bundled gems - `bundle install`
8. Bootstrap the local environment for code signing etc - `fastlane bootstrap --env frollo`
9. (Optional) Bootstrap any other vendor certificates as needed - `fastlane bootstrap --env pioneer`
10. Passwords for the above can be found in 1Password as *Match Password* and *Apple ci@frollo.us*
11. Build! üë∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
